# Avocado-Sales-Googlesheet-Dashboard
A dashboard in googlesheet that analyses sales of avocados in the US from 2015-2020

## Avocado Prices or Sales Dataset Information
Avocado dataset originally compiled from the Hass Avocado Board (or HAB, for short) data and published on Kaggle by Justin Kiggins in 2018. The dataset features historical data on avocado prices and sales volume in multiple cities, states, and regions of the USA. I used an updated version that includes data up to 2020.

This new data was downloaded from the HAB's website which allows downloading the data for years 2017 -- 2020 (as of August 2020).

Huge thanks to Justin Kiggins for the original dataset and to Hass Avocado Board for making the data publicly available!
